# Installation

August currently has two methods of installation, through Cargo and from source.
Both require Rust to be installed.

Plans exist to release prebuilt binaries via CI in the future.

## Via cargo
```
cargo install august-build
```

## From source
```
git clone https://github.com/ScratchCat458/august-build/
cd august-build
cargo install --path .
```
