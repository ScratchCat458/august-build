# Installation

August currently has two methods of installation, through Cargo and from source.
Both require Rust to be installed.

## Via cargo
```
cargo install august-build --locked
```

## From source
```
git clone https://github.com/ScratchCat458/august-build/
cd august-build
cargo install --locked --path .
```

## Prebuilt Binaries

Currently unavaliable until I figure out how to do release engineering properly...
