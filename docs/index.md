# Introducing August

August is a build system much like others of the task-based genre.
It uses a custom syntax for configuring builds and can import other files for the purpose of modularity.

It is a very significant part of my work in software development and creating this has taught me a lot about parsing and error handling.

This documentation covers two main topics, how to use August and how it is built.
Both of these are avaliable from the buttons below and in the top bar.

*Built with love. Built with Rust. Build with August.*
