# Welcome

August is a task-based build system with a strong focus on parallelism.
It is written in Rust, a language known for its stability and performance and relies on custom syntax to describe the build process.

August's name is derived from the name of a *certain* character, from a *certain* game,
whose name is derived from the name of a *certain* German aircraft carrier.[^1]
