# Installation

August currently has two methods of installation, through Cargo and from source.
Both require Rust to be installed.

## Via cargo
```
cargo install august-build
```

## From source
```
git clone https://github.com/ScratchCat458/august-build/
cd august-build
cargo build --release
```

From this point copy the executable into `/bin/` and/or add it to your path.
